Node is asynchronous and event driven. All APIs of node are non blocking and asynchronous. A node server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling and a notifcation mechanism of events helps the server get a response from the previous API call.

Node is single threaded but highly scalable, uses a single threaded model wth event looping. Event mechanics help the server respond without blocking and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.
